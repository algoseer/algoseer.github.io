<h1>Future Research Ideas</h1>
</div>
<p>This page lists a few ideas that I am either working on currently or would like to work on in the future. Most of these ideas are in a very preliminary stage, and will need more detailed thinking or planning. This page is intended to be more of a personal diary/record than a thorough documentation of my work.</p>
<h2>RANSAC for feature selection</h2>
<p><tt>Random Sampling Consensus</tt> is typically used for selecting inlier samples from a dataset with a large number of outliers. It relies on the basic notion that samples that are inlier will have consensus among themselves, whereas outliers will not because they are typically random noise. <tt>RANSAC</tt> is thus often used when the there are expected to multiple inlier models or atleast there is reason to believe that the inlier characteristics have very less variance. </p>
<p>Can the same be extended to feature selection? Feature selection usually relies strictly on accuracy which might be unstable because of overfitting. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is consensus for features? Mutual information? KL divergence of CPPs?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What is an inlier vs. outlier feature?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feature selections vs. feature reduction</p>
</li>
<li><p>Consensus features or diverse features? </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mixture of Markov Chains</h2>
<p>For a long markov process the dynamics might not stay exactly the same during the whole time. Consider, for example a meeting where different topics are being discussed. Different participants will engage in conversation differently depending on the topic. One way to model this might be to think that a particular segment is being generated by one markov chain, and the system keeps switching between these markov chains. Another way is to make the problem soft and say instead that they are being generated by a mixture of markov process. </p>
<p>Questions</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Can the estimation be done in an unsupervised fashion?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Can this be used to automatically segement the regions according to the locally stationary properties?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cross Lingual Tune Matching search engine</h2>
<p>Our previous work based on tune matching employs a full signal time series analysis using DTW. While this yields reliable results, the time complexity is not well suited for real time applications. </p>
<p>To make this task more practical we try to tradeoff between a full time series analysis and using local statistics. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use a hierarchical approach starting with the coarsest statistics</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to finer statistics + some time series modeling</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reduce the number of hypothesis songs at each stage </p>
</li>
</ul>
